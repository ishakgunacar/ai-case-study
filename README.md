# VideaHealth Case Study

## Overview and Origin

VideaHealth is a *venture-backed* company founded in 2018 by Florian Hillen wanting to utilize the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve the diagnostic accuracy of reading dental x-rays, leading to better to patient care [1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dentalai).

## Business Activities

VideaHealth wants to assist dental providers (dentists) and hygenists when it comes to identifying and diagnosing oral disease [2](https://www.videa.ai/about-us). VideaHealth makes providers feel more confident when making a diagnosis [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JInxkCbf2kI). According to the company's website, its mission is to help the more than **200,000** professionally active providers, according to the American Dental Association (ADA), serve 1 billion patients globally with AI [2](https://www.videa.ai/about-us) [12](https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/health-policy-institute/dentist-workforce).

VideaHealth partnered with 42 North, a dental support organization, to better streamline VideaHealth's product into the provider's workflow, leading to a high adoption of VideaHealth's product [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmi1012tFfE). VideaHealth works hard to ensure that their product increases the detection of dental decay, while decreasing false-positive detection i.e. errors. [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN4VgVG9R3o) [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing)

VideaHealth bares a great product with a friendly user interface. For instance, when showing the detection of dental caries, their product boxes the area whereas other companies' product fills the area in; the patient is able to see and understand the dental caries better in the former. Henry Schein One (the world's largest dental practice management software company) chose to partner with them over other major companies in the field due to their high detection rate [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing).

Another solution VideaHealth offers is that it's able to to detect calculus for scaling and root planing (which is a dental procedure to remove the calculus) and its product will take the findings and annotate, give information on what VideaHealth is and attach that to the insurance claim. This leads to a higher insurance claim acceptance rate for scaling and root planing, which insurances commonly deny [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing).

I was only able to speak with a member of the sales team from VideaHealth at the time, so I was not able to find out what exact technologies they use in their AI product, other than using data from radiographs of teeth and applying their AI for detection.


## Landscape

VideaHealth is focused in the healthcare field, specifically dentistry, as are companies like Pearl, Overjet, and ORCA [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing). 

AI and augmented intelligence (which retains elements of human intelligence rather than machine intelligence in its procedures) is primarily used in the analysis of dental images to aid providers in making diagnoses. Specifically, augmented intelligence is used as a tool to assist the provider in the task. However, it is important to keep in mind what Dr. Manny Chopra, The chair of the ADA Council on Dental Practice, says about AI and augmented intelligence in the dental field:

> â€œWhile the integration of AI and augmented intelligence in dentistry is progressing, it's important to note that human expertise and clinical judgment remain essential. Ethical considerations, data privacy and regulatory guidelines are crucial to ensure responsible implementation and protect patient rights." [6](https://adanews.ada.org/ada-news/2023/june/artificial-intelligence-and-dentistry/).

AI should act as a support and not the main driver of clinical decisions, and also patient's right and the law should be kept in mind when designing these products.

AI is gaining more relevance, especially in the speciality of endodontics (which deals with roots of teeth), where it has demonstrated accuracy and precision in terms of disease detection, evaluation, and prediction. This in turn can enhance endodontic treatment results by aiding the advancement of endontontic diagnosis and therapy [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9418762/).

## Results

VideaHealth is the #1 dental AI for Dental Service Organizations and clinicians across the U.S.; This is due to their product's accuracy when it comes to detection [8](https://www.videa.ai/) [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing). They are at the forefront of the AI revolution in dentistry [9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMbvbe_ld3Zh-SV8gUMiWnKRCj8wD85t/view?usp=sharing). As mentioned before, their mission is to help providers serve 1 billion patients globally with AI. 

It uses a few metrics to ensure its success, the growth in annual net production of a dental practice (i.e. dental office) (12% growth); growth in production of restorative (12% growth), periodontal (19% growth), treatment plan acceptance, and the increases the detection of dental disease, while decreasing false-positive detection [9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMbvbe_ld3Zh-SV8gUMiWnKRCj8wD85t/view?usp=sharing) [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing). VideaHealth has shown through their studies that their AI product can reduce the missed instance of cavities by 43%, while reducing false diagnoses by 15%, leading to better patient care, better provider-patient trust, and a more confident feeling provider [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN4VgVG9R3o).

As far as marketing goes, VideaHealth is the clear winner, as I found it hard to find information on its other competitors when doing research into each of them. More importantly, Henry Schein One, after doing a long process of comparison between VideaHealth's competitors, chose to partner with VideaHealth based on all the data mentioned so far. VideaHealth also has a more friendly user interface in comparison to its competitors [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing). 

## Recommendations

I spoke with a member of VideaHealth's sales team. After a good talk over what VideaHealth has to offer, I advised that it would be very beneficial to add a feature to their product where AI aids the provider when writing down a patient's dental record, since these take a good amount of time to write. This would cut down the time the provider spends on writing down time-consuming notes and more time focusing on patient care. This would also add more uniformity, and make dental records easier to read across providers, since each provider has their own style of writing a dental record--this is from what I've noticed from personal experience. This feature would implement **Natural Language Processing**, as you would feed information (human language) to the AI about the patient's diagnostic information, health history and clinical notes, treatments that were performed, and other communications that took place related to the patient during their visit. Once you did this, it would interpret, manipulate, comprehend, and send back out a detailed and complete dental record of the patient. The sales member said that their currently focused on the detection aspect of dental disease and want to perfect that first before moving on to other areas [11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUgKQeblNOyGyuxtXzmee4QjAdxHnoqM/view?usp=sharing).
