# VideaHealth Case Study

## Overview and Origin

VideaHealth is a venture-backed company founded in 2018 by Florian Hillen wanting to utilize the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the diagnostic accuracy of reading dental x-rays, leading to better to patient care [1].

## Business Activities

VideaHealth wants to assist dental providers and hygenists when it comes to identifying and diagnosing oral disease [2]. VideaHealth makes providers feel more confident when making a diagnosis [3]. According to the company's website, its mission is to help providers serve 1 billion patients globally with artificial intelligence [2].

VideaHealth partnered with 42 North, a dental support organization, to better streamline VideaHealth's product into the provider's workflow, leading to a high adoption of VideaHealth's product [4]. VideaHealth works hard to ensure that their product increases the detection of dental decay, while decreasing false-positive detection i.e. errors. [5]


## Landscape

VideaHealth is focused in the healthcare field, specifically dentistry, as are companies like Pearl and ORCA. 

Artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence (which retains elements of human intelligence rather than machine intelligence in its procedures) is primarily used in the analysis of dental images to aid providers in making diagnoses. Specifically, augmented intelligence is used as a tool to assist the provider in the task. The chair of the American Dental Assocation Council on Dental Practice states that while there is progression with this technology, it's important that human expertise and clinical judgement remain essential [6].

Artificial Intelligence has also demonstrated accuracy and precision in the dental specialty of endodontics (which deals with roots of teeth) in terms of disease detection, evaluation, and prediction. This in turn can enhance endodontic treatment results by aiding the advancement of endontontic diagnosis and therapy. [7]


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

VideaHealth is the #1 dental AI for Dental Service Organizations and clinicians across the U.S.; they are at the forefront of the AI revolution in dentistry [8] [9]. As mentioned before, their mission is to help providers serve 1 billion patients globally with artificial intelligence. 

It uses a few metrics to ensure its success, the growth in annual net production of a dental practice (i.e. dental office) (12% growth); growth in production of restorative (12% growth), periodontal (19% growth), treatment plan acceptance, and the increases the detection of dental disease, while decreasing false-positive detection [9]. VideaHealth has shown through their studies that their AI product can reduce the missed instance of cavities by 43%, while reducing false diagnoses by 15%, leading to better patient care, better provider-patient trust, and a more confident feeling provider [10].

As far as marketing goes, VideaHealth is the clear winner, as I found it hard to find information on its other competitors when doing research into each of them.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
