# VideaHealth Case Study

## Overview and Origin

VideaHealth is a venture-backed company founded in 2018 by Florian Hillen wanting to utilize the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve the diagnostic accuracy of reading dental x-rays, leading to better to patient care [1].

## Business Activities

VideaHealth wants to assist dental providers (dentists) and hygenists when it comes to identifying and diagnosing oral disease [2]. VideaHealth makes providers feel more confident when making a diagnosis [3]. According to the company's website, its mission is to help the more than 200,000 professionally active providers, according to the American Dental Association (ADA), serve 1 billion patients globally with artificial intelligence [2] [12].

VideaHealth partnered with 42 North, a dental support organization, to better streamline VideaHealth's product into the provider's workflow, leading to a high adoption of VideaHealth's product [4]. VideaHealth works hard to ensure that their product increases the detection of dental decay, while decreasing false-positive detection i.e. errors. [5]


## Landscape

VideaHealth is focused in the healthcare field, specifically dentistry, as are companies like Pearl and Overjet. 

AI and augmented intelligence (which retains elements of human intelligence rather than machine intelligence in its procedures) is primarily used in the analysis of dental images to aid providers in making diagnoses. Specifically, augmented intelligence is used as a tool to assist the provider in the task. The chair of the ADA Council on Dental Practice states that while there is progression with this technology, it's important that human expertise and clinical judgement remain essential [6].

AI has also demonstrated accuracy and precision in the dental specialty of endodontics (which deals with roots of teeth) in terms of disease detection, evaluation, and prediction. This in turn can enhance endodontic treatment results by aiding the advancement of endontontic diagnosis and therapy. [7]


## Results

VideaHealth is the #1 dental AI for Dental Service Organizations and clinicians across the U.S.; This is due to their product's accuracy when it comes to detection [11]. They are at the forefront of the AI revolution in dentistry [9]. As mentioned before, their mission is to help providers serve 1 billion patients globally with artificial intelligence. 

It uses a few metrics to ensure its success, the growth in annual net production of a dental practice (i.e. dental office) (12% growth); growth in production of restorative (12% growth), periodontal (19% growth), treatment plan acceptance, and the increases the detection of dental disease, while decreasing false-positive detection [9]. VideaHealth has shown through their studies that their AI product can reduce the missed instance of cavities by 43%, while reducing false diagnoses by 15%, leading to better patient care, better provider-patient trust, and a more confident feeling provider [10].

As far as marketing goes, VideaHealth is the clear winner, as I found it hard to find information on its other competitors when doing research into each of them. More importantly, Henry Schein One (the world's largest dental practice management software company), after doing a long process of comparison between VideaHealth's competitors, chose to partner with VideaHealth based on all the data mentioned so far. VideaHealth also has a more friendly user interface in comparison to its competitors [11]. 

## Recommendations

I actually spoke with a member of VideaHealth's sales team. After a good talk over what VideaHealth has to offer, I advised that it would be very beneficial to add a feature to their product where AI aids the provider when writing down a patient's dental record, since these take a good amount of time to write. This would cut down the time the provider spends on writing down time-consuming notes and more time focusing on patient care. This would also add more uniformity, and make dental records easier to read across providers, since each provider has their own style of writing a dental record--this is from what I've noticed from personal experience. This feature would implement Natural Language Processing, as you would feed information (human language) to the AI about the patient's diagnostic information, health history and clinical notes, treatments that were performed, and other communications that took place related to the patient during their visit. Once you did this, it would interpret, manipulate, comprehend, and send back out a detailed and complete dental record of the patient.

The sales member said that their currently focused on the detection aspect of dental disease and want to perfect that first before moving on to other areas [11].
